Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We use Git to help control workflow of a project or product. Git allows the branching feature which allows members of a team to separately work on different aspects of a project and finally merge different branches into one main branch which can be published/distributed to users.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: One field we can use data science for is in the financial industry. With the use of data science, we can predict the stock market and make better investment decisions. A more specific example in the financial industry could be regarding determining when to exercise a stock option. By using data science, we can analyze historical data to predict the optimal time to exercise a stock option to maximize profit.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging is the process of combining two branches into one. Rebasing is the process of moving a branch to a new base commit. The difference between the two is that merging keeps the commit history of the two branches while rebasing rewrites the commit history of the branch being rebased.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am looking forward to learning more about data science and how it can be applied to different fields. I am also looking forward to working on the final group project and applying what I have learned throughout the semester to a real-world problem, and also meeting new people and working with them.
